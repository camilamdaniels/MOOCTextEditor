# MOOCTextEditor
Hello!
 
I added autocomplete and spelling suggestion functionality to this desktop text editor. This was an assignment for a UC San Diego/ Duke University [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance#syllabus) I completed in 2018. 
 
Here are a few screenshots of this project.

 *After clicking the **Flesch Index** button, the Flesch reading ease score of the uploaded document is displayed in the bottom left corner of the application window. Since the **Spelling Suggestions** box is checked, mispelled words are highlighted.*

 *Now, the **AutoComplete** box is checked, so a dropdown automatically pops up with word suggestions. The dropdown is near the bottom left corner of the screen.*
